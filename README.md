#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineerning is the process of designing,development,testing and maintaning of software systems.
        importance of software engineering
    1.Security & Safety – Cybersecurity is a big deal. Properly engineered software helps protect against data breaches and cyberattacks.
    2.Scalability & Growth – Companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix handle millions of users daily because their software is designed to scale.
    3.Quality asuarance-It ensures that applications are reliable,robust and perform as expected.
    4.Scalability and efficiency-Proper engineering ensures it meets users growing demands thus enabling efficiency

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1.Early stages of Software Engineering (1968) – Software engineering was introduced at a NATO conference to address the "software crisis," where projects were failing due to poor planning and lack of structured development methods. This led to the creation of formal engineering principles for software development.

  2.Rise of Structured Programming,including object oriented programing languages (1970s-1980s) – To improve code quality and maintainability, structured programming became popular, emphasizing clear, modular code with control structureslike loops and conditionals. Languages like C and methodologies such as the Waterfall model emerged.

  3.Agile and DevOps Revolution (2000s-Present) – Traditional development methods struggled to keep up with fast-changing requirements, leading to Agile methodologies that focus on flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. DevOps later bridged the gap between development and operations, enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) for faster, more reliable software releases.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1.Planning – Defines project goals, scope, and feasibility. Teams analyze requirements, estimate costs, and create a roadmap for development.

   2.Requirements Analysis – Gathers and documents what the software must do, including functional and non-functional requirements, to ensure it meets user needs.

   3.Design – Architects the software structure, including system design, database models, and user interfaces, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency.

   4.Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and build the software based on the design specifications, using programming languages and frameworks.

   5.Testing – Checks for bugs, security issues, and performance problems through unit, integration, and system testing to ensure the software works as intended.

   6.Deployment – Releases the software to users, whether through a staged rollout or a full launch, making it available for real-world use.

   7.Maintenance  – Provides ongoing support, fixes bugs,updates, and improves features based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    1.Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, while Agile is iterative and flexible.
    2.Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning, while Agile allows for adaptive and continuous planning.
    3.Changes are difficult to implement in Waterfall, while Agile easily accommodates ongoing changes.
    4.Testing occurs after development is complete in Waterfall, while Agile incorporates continuous testing.
    5.Waterfall delivers the full product at the end, while Agile delivers small, incremental releases.
    6.Waterfall teams often work in separate phases, while Agile promotes cross-functional collaboration.
    7.Waterfall requires extensive documentation, while Agile focuses more on working software with minimal documentation.
       Use Waterfall When large scale projects that require a structured approach.
       Use agile when project environment is dynamic and evolving,example software products.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    1. Software Developer writes,tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
    2.Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software meets quality standards before testing.
    3.Project Manager oversees the software development process and ensures timely delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Importance of integrated Development Environments
    1.Provide a unified workspace for writing,deugging and testing code eaxample is the Visual Studio Code.
    2.Reduces errors and improves code quality through built-in tools.
   Importance of Version Control Systems
    1.Facilitates collaboration by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
    2.Supports branching and merging, making it easier to manage feature updates and bug fixes.Example is Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   1.Debbuging and fixing bugs can be time consuming.
     Strategy:Use debugging tools, log errors effectively.
   2.Catching up with rapidly changing technologies.
     Strategy:Continuosly learning through online coourses and conferences to keep up with growing pace
   3.Handling complex code.
     Strategy:Writing clean and modular code for easy navigation.
   4.Managing tight deadlines.
     Strategy:Use AI tools in coding and error detaction for fast quality results
   5.Software vulnarabilities can lead to security breaches.
     Create secure software with available security tools to fix vulnarebilities

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   1.Unit testing - tests fuctions of the software in isolation,it ensures that each module works correctly before integration.
   2.Integration testing - tests interactions between integrated modules or components,it Detects issues in communication between different parts of the system,ensuring seamless dataflow.
   3.System testing - Tests the complete system as a whole to validate its compliance with requirements,it Ensures the entire application functions as expected in a real-world environment.
   4.Acceptance - Evaluates the system from the end-user’s perspective,it Confirms whether the software is ready for deployment and meets customer expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts for effective communication with AI models and achieve desired responses.
      Importance
        1.Improves AI Response Quality – Well-crafted prompts help generate precise, informative, and contextually relevant answers.
        2.It Enhances AI Efficiency – Reduces the need for multiple iterations by providing clear instructions, saving time and effort.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   1.Facts about AI interaction with humans.
   2.Importance of AI and it's impact to human existance.
